They had already seen considerable evolution before Wikidata was launched, and experiences from other wikis are still shaping the way WikiProjects work on Wikidata. There are three main ways in which Wikidata interacts with WikiProjects: (i) Wikidata stores data about WikiProjects across Wikimedia projects, (ii) some WikiProjects are active on Wikidata, (iii) some WikiProjects make active use of structured data from Wikidata. All of these types of interactions continue to shape collaborative curation workflows across Wikimedia projects. This session is to provide an overview of the current state of such interactions and then to zoom in on how structured data or the lack thereof contribute to WikiProject-based collaborative curation workflows.",Description:`The talk will consist of the following parts:\r

Much of it stems from a considerably large amount of data within it being stored unnecessarily, both when this information is not actively used elsewhere on Wikidata and when the information represented by this data can be readily and reliably computed in other ways.\r
\r
This session will highlight ways to keep the amount of *information* on Wikidata constant while reducing the overall size of its *data*, both in terms of the lengths of item pages on wikidata.org and the number of RDF triples in the Query Service's store. It will distinguish between several types of action that may be taken, including 1) what can in principle be done right now without affecting existing workflows, 2) what is also possible now but may require acceptable changes to queries for accommodation, and 3) what is not currently feasible since it necessitates software changes and possibly entirely new storage units. It is expected that some of the proposed actions may be controversial, but this session seeks to defend these actions from at least the standpoints of Wikidata's site health, community health, and usability.\r
\r
It is hoped that, depending on the types of action described, viewers will be inspired to either take these actions directly or encourage those who develop Wikibase, its Lua interface, and the Query Service to make appropriate changes and improvements so that those actions can later be taken.`,"Speaker names":["Mahir Morshed"],Room:{en:"Day 2.5"},Start:"2023-10-29T20:00:00+00:00",End:"2023-10-30T04:30:00+08:00"},{ID:"B3KFN8","Proposal title":"Batch validating Wikidata items using EntitySchemas and entityshape",Abstract:`I'll present a Notebook that can easily be used by anyone to batch check a set of items based on a SPARQL query.\r

It is this system that will be demonstrated here.\r
\r
This session will first exhibit how the lexicographical data on Wikidata—its lexemes ("items for words") and their senses ("word meanings") and forms ("word inflections")—can be best set up for use with any natural language generation system. It will detail how one can model, in a number of different languages in as many different ways, information about the structure of different types of phrases and sentences, the usage styles and circumstances of word meanings, and the different forms and patterns words can take on. The importance of Wikidata item links in many important circumstances will also be highlighted here, not just for linking word meanings across languages but also for ensuring that, if a phrase in a particular language has no direct equivalent or multiple such equivalents in another language, that appropriate choices can be made based on those item links.\r
\r
Throughout this exhibition, potential abstract content will be processed with the Ninai/Udiron *living* text generation system to show how many of the details in the Wikidata items and lexemes shown affect the output of that *living* system. It will clarify what sorts of functionality, whether in the processing of individual abstract content elements or in the manipulation of sentence structure, are expected to be contributed by the community, while acknowledging areas in which--due to limits in the knowledge of the *living* system's sole author--improvements to functionality for certain languages are indeed necessary.\r

 Join us to have fun with Wikidata, and explore language, heritage, and identity, and how you can contribute to their enduring legacies`,Description:`Introduction:\r
Taiwan, known for its linguistic diversity, is home to a fascinating array of indigenous languages. These languages are not only crucial to preserving the island's cultural identity but also hold invaluable insights into its history. In this session, we'll uncover the vibrant world of Taiwan's aboriginal languages and the unique tribes that speak them.\r
\r
Understanding the Indigenous Tapestry:\r
Before we delve into the individual languages, let's appreciate the intricate mosaic of indigenous tribes across Taiwan. The table below showcases some of the remarkable aboriginal tribes, each with their distinct languages and cultural nuances:\r
\r

Exploring the Indigenous Languages:\r
Diving into the languages themselves, we'll uncover the phonetic beauty and linguistic intricacies that set them apart. From the rhythmic tones of Atayal to the melodic nuances of Puyuma, each language tells a story of resilience and cultural pride.\r
\r
Preservation Efforts:\r
Understanding these languages' importance, there has been a growing effort to preserve and revitalize them. The challenge lies not only in documenting their vocabulary and grammar but also in ensuring their transmission to younger generations.\r
\r
Connecting Through Wikidata:\r
Just as we've embraced technology to connect with our global community, we can harness platforms like Wikidata to safeguard these languages' legacy. By collaboratively documenting language details and cultural context, we create a bridge between our modern world and the ancestral voices that echo through these languages.\r
\r
Conclusion:\r
As we conclude our journey through Taiwan's indigenous languages, I hope you feel inspired to contribute to the preservation of this linguistic treasure trove. Our efforts on platforms like Wikidata pave the way for a more inclusive understanding of the world's linguistic heritage.\r

However, this process does come with varying degrees of complexity:\r
\r
Literature Review: Making literature reviews linked and openly accessible can be challenging due to copyright restrictions and the diversity of publication formats. However, databases like PubMed Central and Europe PubMed Central have started to provide linked open data for a subset of their articles, contributing to this aspect.\r
\r
Hypothesis Formulation: While hypotheses could be shared as linked data, the difficulty lies in finding a standardized way to represent them so that they can be understood and compared across different research domains.\r
\r
Data Analysis: This pillar lends itself well to linked data. However, the challenges lie in ensuring data privacy, standardizing data formats, and accurately tagging data to ensure proper categorization and retrieval.\r
\r
Modeling: Computational models can be shared as linked data using certain standards like the Computational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE) standards. However, the challenge here lies in achieving wide-scale adoption of these standards.\r
\r
Optimization: The process of optimization can be complex to represent as linked data due to the iterative nature and the dependence on specific models and data.\r
\r
Result Interpretation and Discussion: As with hypothesis formulation, representing these as linked data could be challenging due to the need for standardization and the qualitative nature of discussions.\r
\r
Communication: Research articles are increasingly being made available as linked data. Scholarly databases like Springer Nature, Wiley, and others have started to publish part of their article metadata as linked data.\r
\r
Peer Review and Revision: This area is more sensitive and complex. While there's increasing interest in open peer review, there are concerns about confidentiality and bias that need to be carefully managed.\r
\r
Thus, while it is certainly possible to transform these pillars into linked data, there are challenges related to standardization, interoperability, privacy, and copyright that must be considered. The increasing recognition of open science and linked data in the scientific community, however, provides a promising foundation for tackling these challenges.\r
\r
Turning experimental and simulation data into linked open data involves several considerations and steps. Here are some general directions:\r
\r
Data Formatting: Data should be formatted in a way that is machine-readable and standardized. This might involve converting data into a format such as XML or JSON-LD, which are commonly used in linked data.\r
\r
Metadata: Providing detailed metadata is crucial for making data understandable and usable. Metadata should describe what the data is, who created it, when it was created, what tools were used, what the units of measurement are, and any other information that might be necessary to interpret the data.\r
\r
Identifiers: Each piece of data should have a unique identifier that can be used to reference it. This might be a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) or a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).\r
\r
Linking Data: In the context of linked data, it's important to link your data to other related data sets. This might involve using common identifiers or vocabularies, or it could involve creating explicit links between your data and other data sets.\r
\r
Licensing: If you want your data to be open, you need to provide it under a license that allows others to use, share, and build upon it. This might be a Creative Commons license, or another type of open license.\r
\r
Publishing: Finally, you need to publish your data in a place where others can find it. This might be a data repository, a database, or a web page.\r
\r
In terms of research directions, there are many possibilities. Here are a few:\r
\r
Developing Tools for Data Conversion: There's a need for tools that can easily convert data from the formats used in tools like MATLAB and Python into formats that are suitable for linked data. This could involve developing new libraries or plugins for these tools.\r
\r
Improving Metadata Standards: While there are many existing metadata standards, there's always room for improvement. Research could focus on developing more comprehensive or more flexible metadata standards.\r
\r
Exploring New Ways to Link Data: Linked data is all about making connections between data sets. Research could explore new ways to make these connections, such as using machine learning to identify potential links.\r
\r
Studying the Impact of Linked Open Data: Finally, research could focus on studying the impact of linked open data. This could involve looking at how linked open data is used, what benefits it provides, and what barriers exist to its use.`,Description:`My speech will focus on the following three fields:\r
1. Experiment data and simulation data can be separated from research itself and become individual entities for open licensing. Therefore it encourages researchers develop their own research on existing foundation thus avoid duplicating efforts and repetitive investments.\r
2. How to transform experiment and simulation data into linked open data? What are the status quo of world wide repositories?\r

\r
One of the ideas is to present and explore the relationship among the datasets in the collection based on their annotated Wikidata keywords as well as the Wikidata properties between the keywords. Such semantic exploration need not be a builtin feature of the _depositar_ as the repository already publishes via data APIs the metadata of all the datasets in its collections (including their Wikidata keywords). This semantic exploration can be a standalone application and it can further rely on the Wikidata services for functionalities. Another idea is to suggest Wikidata keywords from the natural language descriptions given by the users to the datasets as part of their metadata.\r
\r
We will also explore the scenarios where multiple data repositories all publish via data APIs the Wikidata keywords that have been used to annotate their collections. Starting from this, we can have a basis for federated semantic search across data repositories that is driven by the Wikidata infrastructure and its worldwide communities.`,"Speaker names":["Tyng-Ruey Chuang  | 莊庭瑞","Cheng-Jen Lee"],Room:{en:"Day 1","zh-tw":"Day 1"},Start:"2023-10-28T06:00:00+00:00",End:"2023-10-28T14:30:00+08:00"},{ID:"PZF9TA","Proposal title":"Wikifunctions: Fulfilling One of Wikidata's Missing Promises?",Abstract:"A general introduction to Wikifunctions, the new Wikimedia project to create and maintain all kinds of functions that anyone can call, write, maintain, and use",Description:`Wikifunctions is a new Wikimedia project that allows anyone to create and maintain all kinds of functions that anyone can call, write, maintain, and use.

Sharing and linking of knowledge is critical for development. A principal reason why Africa is yet to have robust innovative ecosystems could be rightly attributed to lack of collaborative information sharing practices by researchers and the academia of what they are working on or what they have previously worked on and successes/failures encountered. One of the enduring lessons of the COVID-19 crisis is that the entire world is interconnected as what happens in a region or continent may most likely affect other parts of the world. This brings to the fore the need to open up knowledge to tackle common challenges so that no one is left behind.\r
\r
However, from cursory observations, opening up knowledge for the common good is yet to take root deeply among the academia and researchers in Africa. This could be attributed to a lack of knowledge about digital platforms that promote and drive open practices, understanding about the advantages as well as lack of knowledge and skills on how to successfully share what they know for the benefit of others on such platforms. With a focus on Librarians and other information practitioners within the Africa library sector working in different Library types - public, school, national, academic, research, special, parliamentary libraries etc., at least 200 librarians from at least 20 African countries have been admitted as participants in this course.\r

Share with the audience our unique motivation for engaging with Wikidata ;\r
Share with the audience what our challenges, successes and learning points are so far\r

Currently, the most important of its ties are probably with Wikimedia Commons, which hosts more than 95 million free access images, and English Wikipedia. With nearly 6.7 million articles, English Wikipedia is way ahead of almost all the other language Wikipedias in terms of article numbers. But whereas the ties between Wikidata and Commons are now strong, the ones with English Wikipedia are much weaker, and in need of strengthening. The presenter has been an editor of all three projects for many years. In this presentation, he will share some of his experiences in developing and using templates to tie Wikidata with English Wikipedia. Additionally, he will make proposals for expansions of, and improvements to, the ties between the two projects. As he will demonstrate, such modifications would likely also have a substantial flow-on effect on the ties between Wikidata and other language Wikipedias.",Description:`The presentation could be given either as a General Session (40 minutes) or a Sharing Session (20 minutes), depending upon the time available.\r
\r
The presenter, Jeremy Ludlow (User:Bahnfrend), resides in Perth, Western Australia. He has been an editor of English Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons since November 2009, and of Wikidata since February 2013.\r
\r
Since becoming a Wikimedian, the presenter has always been involved in tying Wikimedia projects to each other. His first contribution to English Wikipedia was a translation of an article from German Wikipedia; his first contribution to Commons was a transfer of an image from German Wikipedia, so that it could be transcluded from Commons to both English and German Wikipedias (and also other Wikimedia projects).\r
\r
As an editor of both Wikidata and English Wikipedia, the presenter has set up and/or used a variety of templates for transcluding data from Wikidata directly to English Wikipedia articles, to some extent in collaboration with Butch Bustria, a well known Wikimedian from the Philippines. In particular, Butch has helped the presenter to adapt for use with East Timorese topics a template he created for Filipino topics; that template has also been translated by other Wikimedians into other languages for use on other language Wikipedias.\r
\r
As an editor of Wikimedia Commons, the presenter also has experience in using the well-known {{Wikidata Infobox}} on that project.\r
\r
The presentation reports on the presenter's experiences with these activities, and makes suggestions as to further work that could and should be done to increase and improve the existing ties between Wikidata and English Wikipedia.`,"Speaker names":["Jeremy Ludlow"],Room:{en:"Day 1","zh-tw":"Day 1"},Start:"2023-10-28T06:40:00+00:00",End:"2023-10-28T15:20:00+08:00"},{ID:"VM7K9E","Proposal title":"The present and future of Wikibase and Wikidata | Wikibase與維基數據的現在與未來",Abstract:`The current state and possibly futures of the development of Wikibase and Wikidata.\r

The *model* strand looks at how gender is represented in the Wikidata ontology, and how this representation has evolved over time. The *data* strand looks at the actual people who are described in Wikidata and at their gender identities. The *community* strand looks at how gender has been discussed by Wikidata users. The three main outcomes of the project, roughly corresponding to the three strands, will be the Wikidata Gender Timeline, a full timeline of gender modeling in Wikidata, the Wikidata Gender Dashboard, showcasing up-to-date statistics about gender identities of people who are described in the knowledge base, and the Wikidata Gender Talk corpus of user discussions.

The presentation will begin with an overview of the current state of biodiversity loss and the need for action to protect endangered species and ecosystems. It will then move on to discuss the role that underrepresented languages can play in this effort, including the unique insights they can offer into local ecosystems and traditional knowledge about conservation practices.\r
\r
The talk will then delve into the potential of crowdsourcing to gather data on biodiversity in these regions. It will explore how crowdsourcing can help to overcome language barriers and allow local communities to contribute to the conservation effort. The presentation will also discuss some of the challenges of using crowdsourcing for biodiversity conservation, such as ensuring the quality and accuracy of the data collected.\r

Taiwanese Tagi is one of the National languages of Taiwan, it is called Taiwanese Min-nan by the Taiwanese government, and the ordinary people called the language Taiwanese(Tâi-oân-ōe). The other ethnic group like the Hakka people called the language Hoklo, and the Min-nan speaking people in the Philippines and Southeast Asia called the language they speak Lan-lang-oe or Hokkien-oe.  There are also other sister languages on WIkimedia-sprere like Cantonese, Eastern Min, and Hakka. I will talk about the current situation of these languages, mostly focusing on the language I am most familiar with - Taiwanese Taigi, and also talk about the situation of Cantonese, Eastern Min, and Hakka on Wikidata, Wikipedia, and other Wikimedia projects.
