# Call for Proposal {.font-size--xxl .font-black .deco}

WikidataCon, the world's largest Wikidata exchange conference, focuses not only on Wikidata itself, but also on the technology that extends beyond Wikidata's platform â€“ e.g. : Wikibase and the Linked Open Data Web, the main focal points extended from our discussions. {.font-size--m}
 
The theme of the year, "<b>Collaboration Across Boundaries</b>",  highlights the cross-disciplinary data exchange, with a greater emphasis on how local data can be linked to international dialogue. In this year's Call for Proposals, we emphasize the diversity of data and how it has been presented by Wikidata and Wikibase, which then includes, but is not restricted to local languages, cultures, folklore, arts, and knowledge. {.font-size--m}
 
`Chinese (zh)` and `English (en)` are the primary languages spoken at this conference. We encourage participants to include their mother tongue contents, in either Chinese or English submissions. {.font-size--m}
 
We also welcome academic proposals in this round. If any research topic is to be published during WikidataCon, we will arrange a professor of this field to review the submission. {.font-size--m}

<b>Please Note:</b> Academic research sessions are limited to On-site sessions in Taiwan only. {.font-size--m}
