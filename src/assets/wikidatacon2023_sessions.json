    "Abstract": "WikiProjects are one of the mechanism by which Wikimedians coordinate their contributions to Wikimedia projects. They had already seen considerable evolution before Wikidata was launched, and experiences from other wikis are still shaping the way WikiProjects work on Wikidata. There are three main ways in which Wikidata interacts with WikiProjects: (i) Wikidata stores data about WikiProjects across Wikimedia projects, (ii) some WikiProjects are active on Wikidata, (iii) some WikiProjects make active use of structured data from Wikidata. All of these types of interactions continue to shape collaborative curation workflows across Wikimedia projects. This session is to provide an overview of the current state of such interactions and then to zoom in on how structured data or the lack thereof contribute to WikiProject-based collaborative curation workflows.",
    "Description": "The talk will consist of the following parts:\r\n- Overview of WikiProjects and similar mechanisms across Wikimedia wikis\r\n- Overview of WikiProjects active on Wikidata\r\n- Overview of structured data that Wikidata has about WikiProjects across Wikimedia wikis\r\n- Overview of how WikiProjects use Wikidata\r\n- Observations about how structured data about WikiProjects can assist collaborative curation both within and beyond WikiProjects",

    "Proposal title": "Making Wikidata Smaller Without Reducing Information",
    "Abstract": "Walkthrough of ways to drastically reduce the size of Wikidata, both as MediaWiki pages and as Query Service data",
    "Description": "Wikidata's growth in recent years has sparked concerns about the likelihood of [the collapse of its Query Service](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/WDQS_backend_update/Blazegraph_failure_playbook) and the increasing inability to edit many of its larger items. Much of it stems from a considerably large amount of data within it being stored unnecessarily, both when this information is not actively used elsewhere on Wikidata and when the information represented by this data can be readily and reliably computed in other ways.\r\n\r\nThis session will highlight ways to keep the amount of *information* on Wikidata constant while reducing the overall size of its *data*, both in terms of the lengths of item pages on wikidata.org and the number of RDF triples in the Query Service's store. It will distinguish between several types of action that may be taken, including 1) what can in principle be done right now without affecting existing workflows, 2) what is also possible now but may require acceptable changes to queries for accommodation, and 3) what is not currently feasible since it necessitates software changes and possibly entirely new storage units. It is expected that some of the proposed actions may be controversial, but this session seeks to defend these actions from at least the standpoints of Wikidata's site health, community health, and usability.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that, depending on the types of action described, viewers will be inspired to either take these actions directly or encourage those who develop Wikibase, its Lua interface, and the Query Service to make appropriate changes and improvements so that those actions can later be taken.",

    "Description": "As Wikifunctions expands after its launch, there will be lots of opportunities to explore how it can be used to realize the Abstract Wikipedia project\u2014that is, what functions might need to be written to do so many simple and complex things for it. Of the numerous other systems for text generation that might be considered for addition to Wikifunctions, *only one* 1) takes *specific* and *direct* advantage of Wikidata's information *and* 2) is *specifically designed* to be as easily as possible to add to Wikifunctions. It is this system that will be demonstrated here.\r\n\r\nThis session will first exhibit how the lexicographical data on Wikidata\u2014its lexemes (\"items for words\") and their senses (\"word meanings\") and forms (\"word inflections\")\u2014can be best set up for use with any natural language generation system. It will detail how one can model, in a number of different languages in as many different ways, information about the structure of different types of phrases and sentences, the usage styles and circumstances of word meanings, and the different forms and patterns words can take on. The importance of Wikidata item links in many important circumstances will also be highlighted here, not just for linking word meanings across languages but also for ensuring that, if a phrase in a particular language has no direct equivalent or multiple such equivalents in another language, that appropriate choices can be made based on those item links.\r\n\r\nThroughout this exhibition, potential abstract content will be processed with the Ninai/Udiron *living* text generation system to show how many of the details in the Wikidata items and lexemes shown affect the output of that *living* system. It will clarify what sorts of functionality, whether in the processing of individual abstract content elements or in the manipulation of sentence structure, are expected to be contributed by the community, while acknowledging areas in which--due to limits in the knowledge of the *living* system's sole author--improvements to functionality for certain languages are indeed necessary.\r\n\r\n(This session is largely a follow-up to the WikidataCon 2021 session [\"Ninai (\u0ba8\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bc8) and Udiron (\u0989\u09a6\u09c0\u09b0\u09a3): text generation with Wikidata items and lexemes\"](https://pretalx.com/wdcon21/talk/J7DVKX/), given how much the described software has evolved since then.)",

    "Proposal title": "Make Experiment and Simulation Data Open and Linked Worldwide !",
    "Abstract": "Turning the following research pillars into linked data is not only possible but is also a promising trend that can significantly enhance the discovery, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of research. However, this process does come with varying degrees of complexity:\r\n\r\nLiterature Review: Making literature reviews linked and openly accessible can be challenging due to copyright restrictions and the diversity of publication formats. However, databases like PubMed Central and Europe PubMed Central have started to provide linked open data for a subset of their articles, contributing to this aspect.\r\n\r\nHypothesis Formulation: While hypotheses could be shared as linked data, the difficulty lies in finding a standardized way to represent them so that they can be understood and compared across different research domains.\r\n\r\nData Analysis: This pillar lends itself well to linked data. However, the challenges lie in ensuring data privacy, standardizing data formats, and accurately tagging data to ensure proper categorization and retrieval.\r\n\r\nModeling: Computational models can be shared as linked data using certain standards like the Computational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE) standards. However, the challenge here lies in achieving wide-scale adoption of these standards.\r\n\r\nOptimization: The process of optimization can be complex to represent as linked data due to the iterative nature and the dependence on specific models and data.\r\n\r\nResult Interpretation and Discussion: As with hypothesis formulation, representing these as linked data could be challenging due to the need for standardization and the qualitative nature of discussions.\r\n\r\nCommunication: Research articles are increasingly being made available as linked data. Scholarly databases like Springer Nature, Wiley, and others have started to publish part of their article metadata as linked data.\r\n\r\nPeer Review and Revision: This area is more sensitive and complex. While there's increasing interest in open peer review, there are concerns about confidentiality and bias that need to be carefully managed.\r\n\r\nThus, while it is certainly possible to transform these pillars into linked data, there are challenges related to standardization, interoperability, privacy, and copyright that must be considered. The increasing recognition of open science and linked data in the scientific community, however, provides a promising foundation for tackling these challenges.\r\n\r\nTurning experimental and simulation data into linked open data involves several considerations and steps. Here are some general directions:\r\n\r\nData Formatting: Data should be formatted in a way that is machine-readable and standardized. This might involve converting data into a format such as XML or JSON-LD, which are commonly used in linked data.\r\n\r\nMetadata: Providing detailed metadata is crucial for making data understandable and usable. Metadata should describe what the data is, who created it, when it was created, what tools were used, what the units of measurement are, and any other information that might be necessary to interpret the data.\r\n\r\nIdentifiers: Each piece of data should have a unique identifier that can be used to reference it. This might be a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) or a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).\r\n\r\nLinking Data: In the context of linked data, it's important to link your data to other related data sets. This might involve using common identifiers or vocabularies, or it could involve creating explicit links between your data and other data sets.\r\n\r\nLicensing: If you want your data to be open, you need to provide it under a license that allows others to use, share, and build upon it. This might be a Creative Commons license, or another type of open license.\r\n\r\nPublishing: Finally, you need to publish your data in a place where others can find it. This might be a data repository, a database, or a web page.\r\n\r\nIn terms of research directions, there are many possibilities. Here are a few:\r\n\r\nDeveloping Tools for Data Conversion: There's a need for tools that can easily convert data from the formats used in tools like MATLAB and Python into formats that are suitable for linked data. This could involve developing new libraries or plugins for these tools.\r\n\r\nImproving Metadata Standards: While there are many existing metadata standards, there's always room for improvement. Research could focus on developing more comprehensive or more flexible metadata standards.\r\n\r\nExploring New Ways to Link Data: Linked data is all about making connections between data sets. Research could explore new ways to make these connections, such as using machine learning to identify potential links.\r\n\r\nStudying the Impact of Linked Open Data: Finally, research could focus on studying the impact of linked open data. This could involve looking at how linked open data is used, what benefits it provides, and what barriers exist to its use.",
    "Description": "My speech will focus on the following three fields:\r\n1. Experiment data and simulation data can be separated from research itself and become individual entities for open licensing. Therefore it encourages researchers develop their own research on existing foundation thus avoid duplicating efforts and repetitive investments.\r\n2. How to transform experiment and simulation data into linked open data? What are the status quo of world wide repositories?\r\n3.

As a result, our focus in 2024 will be on designing methods and tools that attempt to help these small organizations to be equally present in online open access spaces like WikiCommons and the Curationist platform.\r\n\r\nWe present this project to the Wikidata community in order to identify potential challenges to interoperability based on previous work in this area, as well as to surface potential collaborators interested in participating in this initiative with us. This project builds upon work begun on the Curationist technical platform as well as at the Metadata Learning and Unlearning Summit held in June 2023.",

    "Abstract": "Wikidata plays a crucial role in facilitating Named Entities Linking and Relations extraction for companies and researchers. However, it also faces certain limitations. Unlike DBpedia, Wikidata lacks a comprehensive taxonomy of entities, and many entities have a partial list of aliases that could benefit from enrichment. In this talk, we will introduce a database built within Orange that supplements Wikidata with enriched entity information sourced from various external databases using intelligent heuristics. Then we will show how this database can be used to highlight inconsistencies and poor-quality data in Wikidata and across various Wikipedia editions. We will also share our plans to develop robots to seamlessly transfer enhanced data back into the public Wikidata instance, fostering a more robust and accurate knowledge base.",

In this presentation, we aim to talk about some of ideas to further extend the Wikidata keyword feature in the _depositar_.\r\n\r\nOne of the ideas is to present and explore the relationship among the datasets in the collection based on their annotated Wikidata keywords as well as the Wikidata properties between the keywords. Such semantic exploration need not be a builtin feature of the _depositar_ as the repository already publishes via data APIs the metadata of all the datasets in its collections (including their Wikidata keywords). This semantic exploration can be a standalone application and it can further rely on the Wikidata services for functionalities. Another idea is to suggest Wikidata keywords from the natural language descriptions given by the users to the datasets as part of their metadata.\r\n\r\nWe will also explore the scenarios where multiple data repositories all publish via data APIs the Wikidata keywords that have been used to annotate their collections. Starting from this, we can have a basis for federated semantic search across data repositories that is driven by the Wikidata infrastructure and its worldwide communities.",

    "Description": "Wikifunctions is a new Wikimedia project that allows anyone to create and maintain all kinds of functions that anyone can call, write, maintain, and use. Functions are a form of knowledge that can answer questions, such as how many days have passed between two dates or the distance between two cities. More complicated functions can answer more complicated questions, such as the volume of a three dimensional shape, the distance between Mars and Venus on a certain date, or whether two species were alive at the same time.\r\n\r\nOne of our early tasks after launch will be to allow accessing data from Wikidata in Wikifunctions. In this presentation we want to kick off and further the discussion with the Wikidata community about how to work towards that.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it will be possible to integrate the results from Wikifunctions function calls in Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects. These two features together enable the integration of Wikidata\u2019s data into Wikipedia in powerful ways, e.g. in the form of tables, lists, etc. This was initially planned as Phase 3 of the Wikidata project, and we are now working towards delivering on this old promise.",

    "Description": "The availability of interoperable linguistics resources is nowadays more urgent in order to save and help under-resourced languages, and their communities. Despite the efforts, not all languages are represented, nor made accessible in a structured format. Furthermore, well-spread languages, like English or Spanish, took up an overwhelming majority on the Web, while indigenous communities and their resources received less attention. \r\n\r\nIn order to overcome these limitations, we propose a methodology for creating knowledge graphs for under-resourced languages and their communities. By building knowledge graphs we allow the development of applications, the shaping of open educational resources, and the gathering of minority communities in a central space. For instance, we will show how to decentralize demographic contributions with Wikibase, which allows communities to design, create, curate and deploy a mature community-driven knowledge base. Furthermore, the Quechua Language and Knowledge Graph (https://qichwa.wikibase.cloud/) will be showcased. Finally, we will show how educators, students, researchers, and developers may work together for building inclusive applications and resources for all through knowledge graphs.\r\n### Session Outcomes\r\n* Learn how to build a knowledge graph for an under-resourced language\r\n* Know approaches and tools that can help to preserve indigenous language and knowledge.\r\n* Advantages of building/creating knowledge graphs.",

Modifying an existing template can be time-consuming and tedious. Databoxes, however, are sideboxes that can be powered by Wikidata and require less manual work by volunteers.\r\n\r\nThe session will bring together different African language Wikipedia communities from West, East, and North Africa to learn more about how they can leverage the power of Wikidata to improve the quality of articles in their language wikis. It will provide insights into the usefulness of Databox for smaller and under-resourced African language Wikipedias, the importance of linking Wikidata items to Wikipedia articles, and the use of Databox on African language Wikipedias. The session will be useful for Wikimedia communities and will help promote the creation and improvement of articles in African languages.",

    "Abstract": "Making library collections in Africa more visible, open and connected is a major objective of the \u201cPromoting Open Knowledge practices in African Libraries through WikiData\u201d project by AfLIA. The project which is funded by Wikimedia Foundation also aims to drive better understanding of open knowledge and linked data in the African Library sector. This is critical as the organization believes that access to knowledge is crucial for sustainable development and for creating more knowledge.",
    "Description": "Innovations are more prone to happen when there is access to knowledge that can be built on to create more knowledge and value without restrictions. Sharing and linking of knowledge is critical for development. A principal reason why Africa is yet to have robust innovative ecosystems could be rightly attributed to lack of collaborative information sharing practices by researchers and the academia of what they are working on or what they have previously worked on and successes/failures encountered. One of the enduring lessons of the COVID-19 crisis is that the entire world is interconnected as what happens in a region or continent may most likely affect other parts of the world. This brings to the fore the need to open up knowledge to tackle common challenges so that no one is left behind.\r\n\r\nHowever, from cursory observations, opening up knowledge for the common good is yet to take root deeply among the academia and researchers in Africa. This could be attributed to a lack of knowledge about digital platforms that promote and drive open practices, understanding about the advantages as well as lack of knowledge and skills on how to successfully share what they know for the benefit of others on such platforms. With a focus on Librarians and other information practitioners within the Africa library sector working in different Library types - public, school, national, academic, research, special, parliamentary libraries etc., at least 200 librarians from at least 20 African countries have been admitted as participants in this course.\r\n\r\nThe objectives include :\r\nShare with the audience our unique motivation for engaging with Wikidata ;\r\nShare with the audience what our challenges, successes and learning points are so far\r\nPrompt a conversation on ways AfLIA can make an impact on the African library sector and the larger Wikimedia Community with this project especially in the area of driving Openness through linked data and access to knowledge in the continent ;",

    "Abstract": "Wikidata has always been tied to many other Wikimedia projects. Currently, the most important of its ties are probably with Wikimedia Commons, which hosts more than 95 million free access images, and English Wikipedia. With nearly 6.7 million articles, English Wikipedia is way ahead of almost all the other language Wikipedias in terms of article numbers. But whereas the ties between Wikidata and Commons are now strong, the ones with English Wikipedia are much weaker, and in need of strengthening. The presenter has been an editor of all three projects for many years. In this presentation, he will share some of his experiences in developing and using templates to tie Wikidata with English Wikipedia. Additionally, he will make proposals for expansions of, and improvements to, the ties between the two projects. As he will demonstrate, such modifications would likely also have a substantial flow-on effect on the ties between Wikidata and other language Wikipedias.",
    "Description": "The presentation could be given either as a General Session (40 minutes) or a Sharing Session (20 minutes), depending upon the time available.\r\n\r\nThe presenter, Jeremy Ludlow (User:Bahnfrend), resides in Perth, Western Australia. He has been an editor of English Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons since November 2009, and of Wikidata since February 2013.\r\n\r\nSince becoming a Wikimedian, the presenter has always been involved in tying Wikimedia projects to each other. His first contribution to English Wikipedia was a translation of an article from German Wikipedia; his first contribution to Commons was a transfer of an image from German Wikipedia, so that it could be transcluded from Commons to both English and German Wikipedias (and also other Wikimedia projects).\r\n\r\nAs an editor of both Wikidata and English Wikipedia, the presenter has set up and/or used a variety of templates for transcluding data from Wikidata directly to English Wikipedia articles, to some extent in collaboration with Butch Bustria, a well known Wikimedian from the Philippines. In particular, Butch has helped the presenter to adapt for use with East Timorese topics a template he created for Filipino topics; that template has also been translated by other Wikimedians into other languages for use on other language Wikipedias.\r\n\r\nAs an editor of Wikimedia Commons, the presenter also has experience in using the well-known {{Wikidata Infobox}} on that project.\r\n\r\nThe presentation reports on the presenter's experiences with these activities, and makes suggestions as to further work that could and should be done to increase and improve the existing ties between Wikidata and English Wikipedia.",

The other ethnic group like the Hakka people called the language Hoklo, and the Min-nan speaking people in the Philippines and Southeast Asia called the language they speak Lan-lang-oe or Hokkien-oe.  There are also other sister languages on WIkimedia-sprere like Cantonese, Eastern Min, and Hakka. I will talk about the current situation of these languages, mostly focusing on the language I am most familiar with - Taiwanese Taigi, and also talk about the situation of Cantonese, Eastern Min, and Hakka on Wikidata, Wikipedia, and other Wikimedia projects. It is also worth mentioning OpenStreetMap due to its multilingual approach and cross-linked nature to Wikidata and other Wikimedia projects in those southern Sinitic languages. And the future of those languages on Wikimedia-spere.",
